# ID_S10194236_OzzyThamFooMing_Assg02 : Exchange rates website
Website was made with the purpose of providing user with the exchange rates of various currencies including some cryptocurrencies. It was made with the exchangerate.host api (https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs)

Live site: https://ozzywithab.github.io/-ID_S10194236_OzzyThamFooMing_Assg02New/

### Design process

An exchange rate function should return the exchange rates that the user is looking for and provide the user with some history to a certain's currency's performance and a live update on it's value. However, due to API limitations (when using for free, without subscribing), the site is not able to show graphs of it's previous performance (limited requests) and live updates on currency value (updated hourly instead of real-time). To tackle this, the site provides its users with 2 currency converters with the ability to view the exchange rates from different dates so they are able to compare a currency's performance, then and now.

### Features

##### 2 exchange rate converters

It allows users to compare 2 currencies against 2 other currencies or two of the same currency's performance at different dates at the same time

##### Navigation bar

The simple navigation bar includes the name of the site and a button to bring the user to the API's website

##### Features left to implement

* A toggle between dark and light mode

* History tab for the user to see their exchange rate search histories

* Implement weekly graph (Weekly so it doesn't reach request limit that quickly)

### Technologies used

##### API

* An API (https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs) was used for this site and was the main focus of it

### Credits

* Website was built around the exchangerate.host api (https://exchangerate.host/#/#docs)
